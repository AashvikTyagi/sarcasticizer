sticky caps are generally used to show mockery while quoting someone. Sarcasticizer is an application that runs only in the macos statusbar and applies the effect on your copied text!

it was made in python using rumpus and py2app for the app management and pyperclip for clipboard operations.
source code is right above in the files and i'd recommend recompiling the setup.py using py2app as you can learn online because i'd never used it before and have no idea why the application ended up being 13mb (!!!!!).

unzip and download the portable file from [Releases](https://github.com/AashvikTyagi/sarcasticizer/releases/)!

honestly incredibly useful for online debates!
